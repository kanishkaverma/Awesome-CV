\begin{cvletter}



I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Web Developer position at Tradable Bits. As a recent graduate of a BSc in Computer Science, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and take on the challenges of this role.

In my previous experience as a web developer, I have gained a solid understanding of network protocols and core Unix concepts, as well as development experience with scripting languages such as Python, Perl, PHP, and Ruby. I am also skilled in writing clean and functional HTML, CSS, and Javascript without relying on frameworks, and have experience with at least one JS framework or library. My strong SQL language skills and ability to work independently and take ownership of features make me well-suited for this position.

In addition to my technical skills, I have excellent verbal and written communication skills and am comfortable collaborating with a team using VCS such as Git and Mercurial. I am a proactive individual with the initiative to manage my own workload in a constantly evolving environment, and I have a sense of humor and curiosity that I believe would be valuable in a startup environment.

As stated in the job description, I am available to work from either the Vancouver or Victoria locations and am excited about the opportunity to work side-by-side with industry experts and take pride in the success of partners such as Live Nation, MLSE, OCESA, and others. I am also attracted to the competitive salary and full extended benefits, as well as the focus on personal development and mentorship at Tradable Bits.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team.
